# 🐍 Python Beginner Training Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Beginner Training Portfolio — a documented journey of how I built my foundational Python skills through hands-on daily projects, progressive learning, and consistent practice. This folder contains the code I personally worked on and submitted, aligned with my long-term engineering goals.

## 💬 Reflection

> “Python gave me the confidence to build things. It’s not just syntax — it’s about turning logic into reality through code. This phase of my journey laid the foundation for the higher-level programming and AI tools I’ll be using as I move toward embedded AI systems.”

📌 More updates will be added as I continue with functions, classes, file handling, and project integrations.
