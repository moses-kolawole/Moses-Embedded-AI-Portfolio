### ✅ Completed on 23rd June 2025

**Topics Covered:**
- Navigated the MATLAB interface: Command Window, Script Editor, Live Editor
- Used `clc`, `clear`, variable assignments, and basic arithmetic operations

**Projects Completed:**
- **Sine and Cosine Plot:**  
  Plotted sine and cosine waves using `plot()`  
  Added axis labels (`xlabel()`, `ylabel()`) and corrected `legend()` usage

---

### ✅ Completed on 24th June 2025

**Topics Covered:**
- Explored the Workspace, Variable Manager, and Current Folder browser
- Used `clear`, `who`, and `whos` to manage variables

**Projects Completed:**
- Created and deleted variables
- Navigated folders and opened scripts from subfolders without duplication

---

### ✅ Completed on 25th June 2025

**Topics Covered:**
- File types in MATLAB: `.m`, `.mat`, `.fig`
- Saving and loading variables using `save()` and `load()`
- Saving and reopening figures with `savefig()` and `openfig()`

**Projects Completed:**
- Saved variable `x` to `x_value.mat` and reloaded it via full and relative paths
- Loaded `group_vars.mat` from MATLAB's default path
- Used `datestr(now)` to create timestamped save filenames

### ✅ Completed on 26th June 2025

**Topics Covered:**
- Commenting styles: single-line `%` and block `%{ %}`
- Output suppression using `;`
- Case sensitivity and reserved keyword limitations

**Projects Completed:**
- **Circle Area Calculator:**  
  Used inputs, comments, arithmetic, `disp()` and `fprintf()`
- **Multiplier with Pause:**  
  Multiplied values in a loop with `pause()` for timed output
- **Case Sensitivity Demo:**  
  Showed behavior of `value`, `Value`, and `VALUE`
- **Reserved Keyword Fix:**  
  Attempted using `if` as a variable and corrected to `if_val`

---

### ✅ Completed on 27th June 2025

**Topics Covered:**
- Numeric types: `double`, `intX`, `uintX`, `single`
- Logical types: `true`, `false`, `logical`
- Floating-point precision limits: `eps()`, `flintmax`, rounding errors
- Difference between character arrays and string arrays

**Projects Completed:**
- Type checks using `class()`, `isnumeric()`, `islogical()`
- Created a manual truth table using `and`, `or`, `not`, `xor`
- Reversed user-input strings
- Compared strings and chars using `==`, `strcmp()`, and `class()`
