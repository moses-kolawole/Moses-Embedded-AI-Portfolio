# 🔧 C Programming Training Portfolio

Welcome to my C Programming Training Portfolio — a hands-on, progressive track focused on mastering both foundational C syntax and system-level concepts relevant to embedded systems engineering. This folder includes only the projects I personally built and practiced, with a clear breakdown of what was learned and when.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- **Program Structure:** `main()`, `#include`, `return 0`, `gcc` basics  
- **Input/Output:** `printf()`, `scanf()`, format specifiers like `%d`, `%f`, `%s`  
- **Data & Memory:** `int`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `sizeof()`, overflow behavior  
- **Preprocessor Macros:** `__DATE__`, `__TIME__`, and compile-time constants  
- **Variable Qualifiers:**
  - `const` → fixed values like sensor pins, immutable constants
  - `static` → function state retention and file-level scope
  - `volatile` → sensor flags and hardware input variables

- **Embedded Concepts:**  
  - Hardware simulation using flag variables  
  - Scoped memory behavior and lifetime tracking  
  - Volatile interaction mimicking sensor-triggered updates

## 💬 Reflection

> “Learning C isn’t just about syntax. It’s about getting closer to how machines really behave — how memory is managed, how compilers think, and how embedded systems demand precision. These lessons are building blocks for my journey into Embedded AI Engineering.”

📌 More updates will be added as I dive into functions, pointers, memory handling, and microcontroller-specific C workflows.
